start_character = "A"
end_character = "Z"

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Print all the letters from start_character to end_character,
#each on their own line. Include start_character and
#end_character themselves.
#
#Remember, you can convert a letter to its underlying ASCII
#number using the ord() function. ord("A") would give 65.
#ord("Z") would give 90. You can use these values to write
#your loop.
#
#You can also convert an integer into its corresponding ASCII
#character using the chr() function. chr(65) would give "A".
#chr(90) would give "Z". So, for this problem, you'll need
#to convert back and forth between ordinal values and
#characters based on whether you're trying to loop over
#numbers or print letters.
#
#You may assume that both start_character and end_character
#are uppercase letters (although you might find it fun to
#play around and see what happens if you put other characters
#in instead!).

--------------------------------------------------------
#Sample Solution

for i in range(ord(start_character),ord(end_character)+1):
    print(chr(i))

#Sample Solution2

start_character = "A"
end_character = "Z"

#To write a loop, we want to start with "A" and end with "Z".
#So, we know those will be the arguments to the range part
#of our loop.
#
#Those are letters, though. How do we convert them to numbers?
#
#We can use the ord() function:

start_index = ord(start_character)
end_index = ord(end_character)

#Now we have the numbers for our range function. So, we write
#our for loop. We want to include the letter represented by
#end_index, so we'll go to end_index + 1:

for i in range(start_index, end_index + 1):
    
    #Now we want to print the current character. To do that,
    #we need to convert the number back into a character using
    #the chr() function:
    
    print(chr(i))
