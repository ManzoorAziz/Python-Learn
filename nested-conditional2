#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Atlanta is full of great coffee places. Unfortunately, great
#coffee is usually expensive. The variables above will
#contain a balance and a cafe name. Below are the prices of
#a cup of coffee at each of three locations:
#
# - Octane: $6
# - Galloway: $5
# - Starbucks: $4
# - Revelator: $3
# - Dunkin: $2
#
#Add some code above that will print one of the following
#two messages depending on whether the value of balance is
#high enough to buy a cup of coffee at the given cafe.
#
# - If it is sufficient, print "With [balance] dollars, I
#   can buy coffee at [cafe]"
# - If it is not sufficient, print "With [balance] dollars,
#   I cannot buy coffee at [cafe]"

#Sample Solution1


if balance>=2.0 and  cafe=="Dunkin":
    print ("With",balance,"dollars,","I can buy coffee at",cafe)
                    
else:
    if balance>=3.0  and cafe=="Revelator":
        print("With",balance,"dollars,","I can buy coffee at",cafe)
    else:
        if balance>=4.0  and cafe=="Starbucks":
            print("With",balance,"dollars,","I can buy coffee at",cafe)
        else:
            if balance>=5.0  and cafe=="Galloway":
                print("With",balance,"dollars,","I can buy coffee at",cafe)
            else:
                if balance>=6.0 and cafe=="Octane": 
                    print("With",balance,"dollars,","I can buy coffee at",cafe)
                else:

   #Sample Solution2
   
   
   can_afford = True

#Then, for each possible cafe, we check if we can't afford
#it. If we can't, we change can_afford to False:

if cafe == "Octane" and balance < 6:
    can_afford = False

#Notice here that we're using an additional 'if' instead of
#an elif. The reason is that if the conditional above wasn't
#True because it was the wrong cafe, then we still want to
#check the other cafes.

if cafe == "Galloway" and balance < 5:
    can_afford = False
if cafe == "Starbucks" and balance < 4:
    can_afford = False

#Notice also that we could revise this to use a bunch of 'or'
#operators, but that would lead to a loooong line of code.
#We'd rather avoid that.
if cafe == "Revelator" and balance < 3:
    can_afford = False
if cafe == "Dunkin" and balance < 2:
    can_afford = False

#Now, can_afford holds whether we can afford it or not, so
#we can just print our message depending on its value:
if can_afford:
    print("With", balance, "dollars, I can buy coffee at", cafe)
else:
    print("With", balance, "dollars, I cannot buy coffee at", cafe)

 #Sample solution3
 
 cafe = "Octane"
balance = 7.5

#-----------------------------------------------------------
#Notice that the two possible messages we might print are
#only different by three characters: we either print 'can'
#or 'cannot'. So, why not instead make that the variable we
#change?
#
#Most of our code is the same, but notice that we've changed
#can_afford to a string instead of a boolean:

can_afford = "can"

#Our code is the same, but we change can_afford to "cannot"
#if we can't afford the coffee instead of changing it to False.

if cafe == "Octane" and balance < 6:
    can_afford = "cannot"
if cafe == "Galloway" and balance < 5:
    can_afford = "cannot"
if cafe == "Starbucks" and balance < 4:
    can_afford = "cannot"
if cafe == "Revelator" and balance < 3:
    can_afford = "cannot"
if cafe == "Dunkin" and balance < 2:
    can_afford = "cannot"

#The benefit to this is that we don't need a final conditional at
#the end of our program. Instead, we just print the final value
#of the variable can_afford:

print("With", balance, "dollars, I", can_afford, "buy coffee at", cafe)

#If we could afford it, can_afford is the string "can". If we couldn't,
#can_afford is the string "cannot". Either way, the message ends up
#correct!
