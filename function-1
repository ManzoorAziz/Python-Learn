#Write a function called hide_and_seek. The function should
#have no parameters and return no value; instead, when
#called, it should just print the numbers from 1 through 10,
#follow by the text "Ready or not, here I come!". Each
#number and the message at the end should be on its own
#line.
#
#Then, call the function.
#
#There should be no print statements outside the function.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Sample Solution

#Here's the function -- we did this with a loop:

def hide_and_seek():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(i)
    print("Ready or not, here I come!")


#Here's the function call:
hide_and_seek()
