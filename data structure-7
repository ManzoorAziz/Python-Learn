#Write a function called "num_changer" that accepts a string 
#of digits (0-9). You should make an integer from the digits 
#of the even indices and another number from the digits in 
#the odd indices. Return the sum of these two numbers. You 
#can assume the given string will have a length of at least 
#2 digits.
#
#For example, if the string was "123456", you would split
#this into two integers, 135 and 246. Adding them would give
#381. Or if the string was "13579", you would split this into
#159 and 37, then add them to get 196.
#
#Hint: You can do this with loops, but it's easier to do
#this with string slicing. Remember how we could pass a third
#argument to range() that would tell range how many numbers
#to skip? You can do something similar with string slices: if
#you include second colon in a string slice, the number
#that follows it lets you skip characters in the string. For
#example:
#
# "Hello, world!"[1:9] -> This gives "ello, wo".
# "Hello, world!"[1:9:2] -> This gives "el,w". Including :2
#    in the string slice skips every other letter. 
# "Hello, world!" [::3] -> This gives "Hl r!". Leaving the
#    first two spots blank tells it to look at the entire
#    string, but putting :3 at the end says to only take
#    every third character (H, l, space, r, and !).
#
#Hint 2: Remember, Python is zero-indexed. That means the
#first number in the string is at position 0, and so it goes
#in the even list.


#Write your function here!
def num_changer(mystring):
    even=mystring[0:len(mystring):2]
    #print(even)
    odd=mystring[1:len(mystring):2]
    #print(odd)
    return int(even)+int(odd)
    


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: 123456 -> 381
string_int = "123456"
result = num_changer(string_int)
print(string_int + " -> " + str(result))

#Sample Solution

#We'll start with the function header. The function is
#called num_changer, and we'll call its one parameter
#digits:

def num_changer(digits):
    
    #Next, we need to separate out the even digits and the
    #odd digits. We could do that with a pair of loops, but
    #the simpler way is to slice the string.
    #
    #First, let's get the digits in even locations. That
    #means start with the first digit (which is at location
    #0), and select every other digit until the end.
        
    even_digits = digits[0::2]
    
    #Note that above, we technically don't need the first
    #0 -- we're keeping it here to emphasize the difference
    #between getting the even digits and getting the odd.
    #If we just did digits[::2], then Python reads the
    #missing numbers between the colons as meaning
    #'beginning' and 'end'.
    #
    #Next, we'll get the odd digits. The syntax is the
    #same, but we start with the second digit, which is at
    #index 1:
    
    odd_digits = digits[1::2]
    
    #Now, even_digits and odd_digits are both strings. We
    #want to add them together as integers, though. So, we
    #convert them to integers, then add:
    
    return int(even_digits) + int(odd_digits)

#Want to see how to do this with loops, though? Check out
#sample_answer_2.py.

string_int = "123456"
result = num_changer(string_int)
print(string_int + " -> " + str(result))




----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Sample Solution2

#If we want to do this with loops, our function header will
#stay the same:

def num_changer(digits):
    
    #Next, we'll run a loop over each character in digits
    #and assign it to either even_digits or odd_digits
    #depending on its index. That means, though, that we
    #first must create the strings even_digits and
    #odd_digits to add to:
    
    even_digits = ""
    odd_digits = ""
    
    #Now, we run our loop. We could do this two ways: a
    #for-each loop that keeps track of the current index
    #manually, or a for loop that uses the loop variable to
    #look up the right character in digits. Since this
    #chapter is on strings, let's use the latter:
    
    for i in range(0, len(digits)):
        
        #Now, we want to decide whether the current
        #character is at an even index or an odd index. We
        #can use the modulus operator for that:
        
        if i % 2 == 0:
            
            #If that's true, then this is an even index,
            #so we add the current character to even_digits:
            
            even_digits += digits[i]
            
        else:
            
            #Otherwise, it's odd, so we add it to odd_digits:
            
            odd_digits += digits[i]
    
    #Now, the result when we reach this line is the same as
    #when we used string slicing, so our final line is the
    #same:
    
    return int(even_digits) + int(odd_digits)


string_int = "123456"
result = num_changer(string_int)
print(string_int + " -> " + str(result))
