#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Imagine you're deciding what you want to cook. The boolean
#variables above state whether or not you have each of those
#four ingredients.
#
#Here are the dishes you know how to cook and their
#ingredients:
#
# 1. pancakes: egg, milk, butter, flour
# 2. omelette: egg, milk, butter
# 3. custard: egg, milk
# 4. poached eggs: egg
#
#The list above is also a priority list. If you have the
#ingredients for pancakes, you'll make pancakes instead of
#any of the other dishes. If you're missing flour but have
#the other ingredients, you'll make an omlette. You'll only
#make poached eggs if the only ingredient you have is eggs.
#
#Complete the program below such that it prints which dish
#you'll make based on the ingredients you have handy. All
#the dishes should appear exactly as shown above: all lower
#case, spelled the same way. If you do not have the
#ingredients to make any of these dishes, then print the
#text "Go to the store!"

#Sample Solution1

if (egg and milk and butter and flour)==1:
    print("pancakes")
elif (egg and milk and butter)==1:
    print("omelette")
elif (egg and milk)==1:
    print("custard")
elif egg==1:
    print("poached eggs")
else:
    print("Go to the store!")
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 #Sample Solution2
 
 egg = True
milk = True
butter = True
flour = True

#Based on what you've seen so far, the most obvious way to
#do this is to have a separate if statement for each
#possible recipe. Then, if we can't make any of them, print
#"Go to the store!".
#
#It's important, though, that we put them in the right order.
#Imagine if you did this:

#if egg:
#    print("poached eggs")
#elif egg and milk:
#    print("custard")

#The if egg and milk are both true, we want to print
#"custard". However, the first condition will trigger because
#egg is true, so we'll never check the second because it's an
#else. So, we want to check these conditions in the order of
#priority:

if egg and milk and butter and flour:
    print("pancakes")
elif egg and milk and butter:
    print("omelette")
elif egg and milk:
    print("custard")
elif egg:
    print("poached eggs")
else:
    print("Go to the store!")
    
#However, there is a better way to do this. Check out the
#other sample answer to see!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Sample Solution3
egg = True
milk = True
butter = True
flour = True

#One bit of inefficiency with the previous code is that we
#checked egg four times, milk three times, and butter twice.
#Ideally, though, we would never check any of them more than
#once. Here's a redesigned version that works that way:

if egg:
    if milk:
        if butter:
            if flour:
                print("pancakes")
            else:
                print("omelette")
        else:
            print("custard")
    else:
        print("poached eggs")
else:
    print("Go to the store!")

#egg is required for all our dishes. So, we know if egg is
#False, we can go ahead and print "Go to the store!": we can't
#make anything without eggs. So, our top-level (least indented)
#conditional checks egg, and if egg is False, it jumps straight
#to the else at the very end.
#
#If egg is true, though, we know that we're guaranteed to make
#one of our recipes. So, we don't need to check egg again: now
#we just need to see if we have milk, butter, and flour. If we
#don't have milk, then we know what we're making: poached eggs.
#
#If both egg and milk are true, we know we'll either make
#pancakes, custard, or an omelette. So, instead of checking
#every dish's ingredient every time, we instead can sort of
#narrow down our list of possible results.
