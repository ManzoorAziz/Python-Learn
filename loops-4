#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Write some code below that will count and print how many
#times mystery_character appears in mystery_string. You may
#not use the string class's .count method.
#
#With the original values for mystery_string and
#mystery_character, your code should initially print 4. Only
#count characters with the same case as mystery_character
#(in other words, here you would ignore capital A).

#Sample Solution1



counter = 0

for i in range(len(mystery_string)):  

   if (mystery_character ==  mystery_string[i]):

       counter+=1

print (counter)

#Sample Solution2

mystery_string = "Hello! What a fine day it is today."
mystery_character = "a"

#First, we're counting something, so we start by initializing
#a counter to 0:
count = 0

#Now, we want to iterate through each character in mystery_string.
#We can do that with this loop:
for a_character in mystery_string:
    
    #Next, we want to compare the current character in the string
    #to mystery_character to see if they're the same.
    if a_character == mystery_character:
        
        #If so, we add to the counter:
        count += 1
        
#Then, at the end, we print the counter:
print(count)
