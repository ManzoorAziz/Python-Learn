#Consult this blood pressures chart: http://bit.ly/2CloACs
#
#Write a function called check_blood_pressure that takes two
#parameters: a systolic blood pressure and a diastolic blood
#pressure, in that order. Your function should return "Low",
#"Ideal", "Pre-high", or "High" -- whichever corresponds to
#the given systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
#
#You should assume that if a combined blood pressure is on the
#line between two categories (e.g. 80 and 60, or 120 and 70),
#the result should be the higher category (e.g. Ideal and
#Pre-high for those two combinations).
#
#HINT: Don't overcomplicate this! Think carefully about in
#what order you should check the different categories. This
#problem could be easy or extremely hard depending on the
#order you change and whether you use returns or elifs wisely.


#Add your code here!
        

#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: Ideal
test_systolic = 80
test_diastolic = 50

print(check_blood_pressure(test_systolic, test_diastolic))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Sample Solution

#First, we define the function. It has two parameters:
#systolic and diastolic.
def check_blood_pressure(systolic, diastolic):
    
    #Low blood pressure is easy: systolic must be under 90
    #and diastolic must be under 60.
    if systolic < 90 and diastolic < 60:
        return "Low"
    
    #For Ideal, we know that systolic must be less than 120
    #and less than 80. However, how do we handle making sure
    #it's Ideal and not Low? For example, if systolic is 80,
    #then diastolic needs to be above 60, but if systolic is
    #100, then diastolic just needs to be above 40.
    #
    #But we don't need to worry about that! If it was Low,
    #then the function would have already ended based on the
    #conditional above. So, if we reach this line, we *know*
    #that it isn't low. So, we just check if it's Ideal:
    elif systolic < 120 and diastolic < 80:
        return "Ideal"
    
    #By that same logic, if we reach the next conditional,
    #we know it's neither Low nor Ideal: so, we just check
    #if it's Pre-high:
    elif systolic < 140 and diastolic < 90:
        return "Pre-high"
    
    #If it's not Low, Ideal, or Pre-high, it must be High:
    else:
        return "High"
