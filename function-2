#In function-1, you created a function
#called hide_and_seek that printed the numbers from 1 to 10.
#Now, however, we want to extend that. What if we want to
#count to 20? 30?
#
#Modify your previous function so that it takes as input one
#parameter: count. Then, instead of printing the numbers from
#1 to 10, it should print the numbers from 1 to the value of
#count. Then, end with "Ready or not, here I come!"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Sample Solution 

def hide_and_seek(count):
    for i in range(1,count+1):
        print(i)
    print("Ready or not, here I come!")


#The function call below will test your function. We'll delete
#and overwrite this with other calls to hide_and_seek with
#different numbers during grading:
hide_and_seek(36)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#EXPLANATION

#As usual, we'll start with the function header. The function
#is called hide_and_seek and has one parameter, count:

def hide_and_seek(count):
    
    #Because we don't know how many lines we'll need to print,
    #we need to use a loop. The loop will start at 1 (because
    #the first number we print is 1) and run to count + 1
    #because Python loops are exclusive (meaning they go
    #up to, but do not include, the second number):
    
    for i in range(1, count + 1):
        print(i)
    
    #Then at the end, we print this message outside the loop
    #so that it's only printed once:
    print("Ready or not, here I come!")


hide_and_seek(36)
