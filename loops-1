mystery_int = 7

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Write a for loop that prints every third number from 1 to
#mystery_int inclusive (meaning that if mystery_int is 7, it
#prints 1, 4, and 7). Print each number on a separate line.
#
#Hint: There are multiple ways to do this! You might use the
#modulus operators, or you could use the third argument for
#range().
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

#Sample Solution1

for mystery_int in range(1,mystery_int+1,3):
    print (mystery_int)
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Sample Soultion2
mystery_int = 50

#There are at least two ways we could do this. The first
#uses an extra arugment for range():

for i in range(1, mystery_int + 1, 3):
    print(i)

#By adding 3 as our third argument (called the 'step'), we
#tell Python to give us every 3rd number starting at 1.
#Note that we have to run to mystery_int + 1 because the
#range function runs up to, but does not include, the
#second argument. If we exclude the + 1, then we wouldn't
#get the last number in some cases.

#The other approach is to use the modulus function: iterate
#over every number, but only print if dividing it by 3
#gives a remainder of 1. That's what's in common between
#the numbers 1, 4, 7, 10, etc.:

for i in range(1, mystery_int + 1):
    if i % 3 == 1:
        print(i)
