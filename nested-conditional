#The United States has a movie rating system that rates
#movies with one of five ratings: G, PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17.
#Although some of the ratings are not binding, imagine that
#you are a parent who decides on the following rules:
#
# - Any child can see a G-rated movie.
# - To see a PG-rated movie, your child must be 8 or older.
# - To see a PG-13-rated movie, your child must be 13 or older.
# - To see an R-rated movie, your child must be 17 or older.
# - Your child may never see an NC-17 movie.
#
#The variables above give a rating and a child's age. Use
#these variables to select and print one of these two
#messages based on the criteria above:
#
# - "You may see that movie!"
# - "You may not see that movie!"
#
#However, there's one trick: you may not use the 'and' operator
#anywhere in this code!

 #Sample Solution3

#Now, instead of printing within every branch of our
#conditionals, let's instead only print at the end. We'll
#create a boolean that will track whether the kid has
#permission, and then at the end we'll use it to decide what
#to print. That cuts down on our duplicate print statements.
#
#Then, we could do the same thing as we did in the other
#sample answer, just replacing the print statements with
#permission = True and permission = False. However, we can
#make it even simpler since we're not printing to the end.
#Instead of ever saying permission = True inside a
#conditional, let's instead just assume that it's True, and
#check for reasons to switch it to False. That lets us get
#rid of all our else blocks!

#So, assume permission is True unless we find reason to
#change it...
permission = True

#Check for reasons to change it...
